        <h2>How much has there been?</h2>
        <p>Humans have been releasing greenhouse gases into the atmosphere for a very long time. However it was not 
          until the dawn of the industrial revolution in the mid-19th century where the rate of emissions around the
          world started increasing drastically. 
        </p>
        <p>This is illustrated by the chart on the left hand side where the rise of industrialisation is clearly
           shown by the corresponding increase in greenhouse gases being emitted over time, primarily in the last 50
           years where greenhouse gas emissions have increased by roughly 90%. Interestingly, there was a decline of 
           almost 5% in 2020 due to the pandemic diminishing demand for fossil fuel energy sources but this is projected
           to rebound as the world returns normal operation.
        </p>
        <p>
           This is largely due to the development of digital and personal computing and the internet gave way to the 
           third industrial revolution. Internet and computer technology, international air travel and satellite 
           communications were catalysts to globalization and there was a consequent growth in multinational companies
           moving their manufacturing to asian countries. That being said, it is important to note that population 
           growth tends to also increase emissions due to an increase in consumption which may make some continents
           appear to be causing greater emissions than others where in reality emissions per capita or land use 
           may indicate otherwise.

        <h2>What is GDP and Capita's effect on emissions?</h2>
        <p>Statistics show that there is a clear link between GDP and emissions. According to the scatter plot to the
          right which looks at GDP vs emissions (per capita), there is a positive trend between a country's GDP and their 
          emissions. The top 20 global economies account for more than 78% of global greenhouse gas emissions. Material
          footprint per capita is more than 10 times higher in high-income countries than that of low income countries.

        <h2>What's it all coming from?</h2>
        <p>According to the National Greenhouse and Energy Reporting (NGER), the greenhouse gases are carbon dioxide,
          methane, nitrous oxide and various Fluorinated gases (including hydrofluorocarbons, perfluorocarbons, sulphur
          hexafluoride, nitrogen trifluoride etc.). The bar chart to the right indicates how much of each gas is emitted
          around the world as a percentage of total greenhouse gas emissions. It is clear that carbon dioxide, Co2, is
          the most abundant greenhouse gas. This is primarily due to the burning of fossil fuels which is the predominant
          way of generating energy in this day and age. The pie chart to the far right indicates emission contribution as
          a percentage from each sector. Agriculture, electricity & heat production and industry (24%, 25%, 21% respectively),
          are the largest contributors to emissions and this makes sense as those sectors by nature are utilizing the most
          fossil fuels.
